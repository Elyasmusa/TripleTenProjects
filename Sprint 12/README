Sprint 12: Neural Networks and Deep Learning

Project Requirements
Part 1: Data Loading and Exploration
Download and load the dataset. Examine the data to understand:

How many records are in the dataset
What the features look like
The distribution of the target variable (charges)
Are there any missing values
What the data types are for each column
Part 2: Data Preprocessing
Prepare your data for neural network training:

Handle Categorical Variables:
You have categorical features (sex, smoker, region) that need to be converted to numbers. You can use one-hot encoding or label encoding.

Normalize Numerical Features:
Scale your numerical features (age, bmi, children) to similar ranges. Remember from the lessons that neural networks work best with normalized inputs.

Split Your Data:
Divide your data into training and testing sets. A typical split is 80% for training and 20% for testing. Make sure to split BEFORE you normalize to avoid data leakage.

Normalize the Target Variable (Optional but Recommended):
Consider normalizing the charges variable as well since insurance costs can range widely. This will make training more stable.

Part 3: Build Your Neural Network
Design and build a neural network architecture using Keras:

Model Architecture:
You are free to choose:

The number of hidden layers
The number of neurons per layer
The activation functions to use
Whether to include dropout or other regularization
Start simple and iterate. Remember the lessons on underfitting and overfitting.

Compile Your Model:
Choose appropriate:

Optimizer (Adam is a good default)
Loss function (what's appropriate for regression?)
Metrics to track (MAE or MSE are good choices)
Part 4: Train Your Model
Train your neural network:

Set Training Parameters:

Choose a reasonable number of epochs
Select an appropriate batch size
Consider using validation data during training
Monitor Training:
Keep track of both training and validation loss to detect underfitting or overfitting.

Experiment and Iterate:
If your first model doesn't work well, try adjusting:

The number of neurons or layers
The learning rate
The number of epochs
Adding or removing regularization
Part 5: Evaluate Your Model
Assess your model's performance:

Quantitative Evaluation:
Calculate performance metrics on your test set:

What is the test loss?
What is the mean absolute error?
How do these compare to your training metrics?
Qualitative Evaluation:

Make predictions on a few test examples
How far off are the predictions from actual values?
Do the predictions make sense?
Diagnose Issues:

Is your model underfitting (high training and test loss)?
Is your model overfitting (low training loss, high test loss)?
Is your model well-balanced?
Part 6: Visualization and Analysis
Create visualizations to understand your model:

Training History:
Plot training and validation loss over epochs. What does this tell you about your model?

Predictions vs Actual:
Create a scatter plot comparing predicted charges to actual charges. How close are they to the diagonal line?

Model Architecture:
Display your model summary. How many total parameters does your model have?

Part 7: Write a Summary
Document your findings in a clear summary:

Process:

Briefly describe your data preprocessing steps
Explain your model architecture choices
Describe any experimentation you did (different architectures, hyperparameters)
Results:

Report your final test set performance
Is your model underfitting, overfitting, or well-balanced?
What was your best model configuration?
Insights:

What features seem most important for predicting insurance costs?
What would you do differently if you had more time?
What improvements could be made to the model?
Deliverables
Submit the following:

Jupyter Notebook or Python Script containing:
All data loading and preprocessing code
Model building and training code
Evaluation and visualization code
Comments explaining your decisions
Summary Document (can be in the notebook or separate):
Description of your approach
Results and findings
Reflection on the process
Visualizations:
Training/validation loss curves
Predictions vs actual scatter plot
Any other relevant visualizations
